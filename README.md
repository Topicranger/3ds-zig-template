This is a very basic template to kickstart *your* zig adventures on 3DS ðŸ¦Ž

Here be dragons - zig is still in development and things might have changed already!<br>
It actually just exists because others were outdated.

## Dependencies

- zig >= `0.14.0`
- devkitPro for 3ds development

## Usage

- `zig build 3ds` - builds to zig-out
- `zig build run` - builds and runs the app in an emulator

App description and more are stored in the buildfile. Customize it and make it your own!
